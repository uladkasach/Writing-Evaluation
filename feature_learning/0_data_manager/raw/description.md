The following information was retreived from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5659.pdf:

In sets 1 and 2, a student is asked to write persuasively. Essay set 1 has the student
take a position on the effects of computers on society and write a letter to the editor of
a newspaper arguing for this position. Sets 3-6 are response to source prompts; they
have the student read and analyze some source text and provide evidence from the text
to support their analysis. The source of essay set 5 is a passage about the son of Cuban
immigrants growing up in New Jersey. The student must describe the mood of the text.
The narrative task tends to be more open ended. In essay set 8, the task is to write about
an experience in which laughter was an important element.
