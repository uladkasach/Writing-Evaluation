Analysis:

For Now:
Calculate similarity statistics between consecutive words surrounding sentence delimiting periods (e.g., "the dog ran. the cat walked" analyze "ran" -vs- "the", and when analyzing w/o stopwords, analyze "ran" -vs- "cat") 
Calculate similarity statistics of consecutive words in a sentence
Claculate similarity statistics of consecutive words overall


Future:
calculate similarity statistics leading to paragraph delimination

Generall punctuation:
Evaluate the cosine similarity between word vectors surrounding punctuation. See if there is a pattern associated with the different types of punctuation.

E.g., is the cosine similarity between words surrounding a period bigger than those surrounding a comma?
What about the average of the to preceeding and following
what about the "skip" two words
